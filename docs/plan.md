# PPDB Next.js Project Plan

## Recent Updates

### ✅ Node.js Upgrade & SWC Binary Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Node.js version 16.20.2 was incompatible with Next.js 14.2.13+ and missing SWC binary
- **Solution**:
  - Upgraded Node.js to version 18+ (required for Next.js 14.2.13+)
  - Installed `@next/swc-darwin-arm64` package for ARM64 macOS compatibility
  - Fixed package manager conflicts (removed yarn.lock, using npm)

### ✅ Next.js 15+ Async Params Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Dynamic route params were being accessed synchronously, causing errors in Next.js 15+
- **Solution**: Updated `/app/jenjang/[slug]/layout.tsx`:
  - Changed `params` type from `{ slug: string }` to `Promise<{ slug: string }>`
  - Added `await` keyword when accessing `params.slug` in both `generateMetadata` and `PageLayout` functions
  - Made `PageLayout` component async

### ✅ Dependency Resolution Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Version mismatch between Next.js 15.5.4 and @next/third-parties 14.2.13 causing ERESOLVE errors
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `@next/third-parties` to version 15.5.4 to match Next.js version
  - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve React 19 compatibility issues with Radix UI packages
  - Resolved dependency conflicts between React 19.2.0 and older Radix UI components

## Current Status

- ✅ Development server running successfully
- ✅ SWC binary issues resolved
- ✅ Async params compatibility fixed
- ✅ Dependency conflicts resolved
- ✅ No linting errors

## Technical Stack
