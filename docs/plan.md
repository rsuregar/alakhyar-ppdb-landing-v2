# PPDB Next.js Project Plan

## Recent Updates

### ✅ Node.js Upgrade & SWC Binary Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Node.js version 16.20.2 was incompatible with Next.js 14.2.13+ and missing SWC binary
- **Solution**:
  - Upgraded Node.js to version 18+ (required for Next.js 14.2.13+)
  - Installed `@next/swc-darwin-arm64` package for ARM64 macOS compatibility
  - Fixed package manager conflicts (removed yarn.lock, using npm)

### ✅ Next.js 15+ Async Params Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Dynamic route params were being accessed synchronously, causing errors in Next.js 15+
- **Solution**: Updated `/app/jenjang/[slug]/layout.tsx`:
  - Changed `params` type from `{ slug: string }` to `Promise<{ slug: string }>`
  - Added `await` keyword when accessing `params.slug` in both `generateMetadata` and `PageLayout` functions
  - Made `PageLayout` component async

### ✅ Dependency Resolution Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Version mismatch between Next.js 15.5.4 and @next/third-parties 14.2.13 causing ERESOLVE errors
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `@next/third-parties` to version 15.5.4 to match Next.js version
  - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve React 19 compatibility issues with Radix UI packages
  - Resolved dependency conflicts between React 19.2.0 and older Radix UI components

### ✅ React Version Compatibility Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: React 19.2.0 incompatible with @radix-ui/react-icons and other packages, causing deployment failures
- **Solution**:
  - Downgraded React from 19.2.0 to 18.3.1 for better compatibility
  - Updated @types/react and @types/react-dom to version 18
  - Resolved Vercel deployment dependency conflicts

### ✅ Next.js 15 Page Component Architecture Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Next.js 15+ requires page components to handle Promise params, but client components cannot be async
- **Solution**:
  - Refactored page component architecture to separate server and client concerns
  - Created `JenjangPageContent.tsx` as a client component to handle Firebase hooks and analytics
  - Made main page component async server component that passes Promise params correctly
  - Maintained all existing functionality while ensuring Next.js 15+ compatibility

### ✅ Client Component Directive Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: CallToAction component was missing `'use client'` directive, causing webpack build errors
- **Solution**:
  - Added `'use client'` directive to `CallToAction.tsx` component
  - Resolved React hooks usage in server component context
  - Fixed webpack build errors related to useEffect and useState usage

### ✅ Vercel Deployment Platform Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: `@next/swc-darwin-arm64` package is macOS ARM64 specific, causing Vercel deployment failure on Linux x64
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `@next/swc-darwin-arm64` package from dependencies
  - Next.js will automatically use the appropriate SWC binary for the deployment platform
  - Resolved EBADPLATFORM error during Vercel deployment

### ✅ Navigation Hydration Error Fix (Completed)

- **Issue**: Nested `<a>` tags in navigation menu causing React hydration errors
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `NavLink.tsx` component structure to prevent nested anchor tags
  - Used `NavigationMenuLink` with `asChild` prop correctly to avoid double wrapping
  - Restructured Link components to use proper Next.js Link + NavigationMenuLink pattern
  - Resolved hydration mismatch between server and client rendering
